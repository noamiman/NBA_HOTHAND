# 🔥 Is the "Hot Hand" in Basketball Real?

As a basketball player, I’ve often heard teammates and commentators talk about the "hot hand" — the idea that a player who just made a shot is more likely to make the next one.

But is it actually true?

This project explores the **"hot hand fallacy"** using real NBA data from the 2024–25 season.  
We analyze whether top scorers improve their shooting accuracy after a made shot — or if it's just an illusion created by how our brains interpret streaks.

## 🧠 Final Insight

The data suggests that most players do **not** shoot significantly better after making a shot — and some even shoot better after a miss.  
This supports the idea that the "hot hand" is more of a **cognitive illusion** than a real performance effect.

Our brains are amazing — but they love to spot patterns, even when they’re not really there.
